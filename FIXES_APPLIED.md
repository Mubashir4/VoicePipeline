# Fixes Applied to Voice Pipeline

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Google Cloud Speech API Model Compatibility Error
**Problem**: Urdu (ur-PK) and several other languages were failing with the error:
```
Invalid recognition 'config': The requested model is currently not supported for language : ur-PK
```

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent model selection based on language compatibility:
- **Enhanced Languages** (latest_long + useEnhanced): English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean
- **Standard Languages** (latest_short): Urdu, Arabic, Hindi, Turkish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Dutch, Chinese
- **Basic Languages** (default model): All other languages as fallback

### 2. ESLint Warning for Unused Function
**Problem**: `renderSpeakerSegments` function was defined but never used, causing persistent warnings.

**Solution**: Removed the unused function completely since speaker information is now handled directly in the message rendering.

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
**Added**: Model quality indicators in the language selector:
- **Enhanced** (Green): Highest quality with advanced features
- **Standard** (Orange): Good quality with basic features  
- **Basic** (Gray): Standard quality fallback

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`server.js`)
```javascript
const getModelForLanguage = (langCode) => {
  const enhancedLanguages = ['en-US', 'en-GB', 'es-ES', ...];
  const basicModelLanguages = ['ur-PK', 'ur-IN', 'ar-SA', ...];
  
  if (enhancedLanguages.includes(langCode)) {
    return { model: 'latest_long', useEnhanced: true };
  } else if (basicModelLanguages.includes(langCode)) {
    return { model: 'latest_short', useEnhanced: false };
  } else {
    return { model: 'default', useEnhanced: false };
  }
};
```

### Frontend Changes (`SpeechRecognition.tsx`)
- Added model quality indicators
- Removed unused `renderSpeakerSegments` function
- Enhanced language dropdown with model information
